### Meowt of Tune
A tense, atmospheric puzzle-platformer where light is both your tool and your tormentor. Navigate a haunting world of shadows, solving intricate puzzles that rely on clever manipulation of lighting and darkness. But beware, lurking in the gloom is a giant, relentless rat that hunts by sound and sight. Your goal? Outsmart the predator, survive the shadows, and steal the sacred can of tuna that lies just beyond its lair.

#### Controls

Movement: Players use the standard WASD or arrow keys to move the character around the environment. In the default 3D perspective, movement is relative to the camera's direction.

Jumping: The Spacebar is used to make the character jump.

Object Interaction: The player can interact with certain objects to either drag them along the ground, carry them or click on them to complete their puzzle tasks. This is handled through a general interaction system, using left click on your mouse.
