> Navigate a haunting world of shadows, solving intricate puzzles that rely on clever manipulation of lighting and darkness. But beware, lurking in the gloom is a giant, relentless rat that hunts by sound and sight. Your goal? Outsmart the predator, survive the shadows, and steal the sacred can of tuna that lies just beyond its lair.

## Core Mechanics

*Meowt of Tune* combines platforming with puzzle and stealth elements, built around a set of unique mechanics.

### **Dynamic Camera System**
The game uses a trigger-based system to automatically switch camera perspectives as you move through different areas. The default is a third-person view, but entering specific zones transitions the camera to a top-down perspective, altering gameplay and movement controls.

### **Light-Based Hazards**
Light is not always your friend. Certain areas are bathed in hazardous light. If you step into one of these zones, you will be caught and respawned at the last checkpoint. Use the shadows to your advantage!

### **Noise Generation System**
Be careful where you step! Actions like jumping and colliding with objects generate noise. This noise level is tracked and can have consequences...

### **The Enemy AI (The Shop Owner)**
If you make too much noise, the giant, mutated Shop Owner rat will begin its hunt. It uses both sight and sound to track you. The enemy will despawn if you can successfully hide in a designated hiding spot or evade it for long enough.

### **Object Manipulation**
Interact with the world to solve puzzles:
-   **Dragging:** Certain objects can be grabbed and pulled to clear paths or trigger mechanisms.
-   **Carrying:** Other objects, including key items, can be picked up and carried to new locations.
